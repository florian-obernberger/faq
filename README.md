## Build Requirements

* [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
* [yj](https://github.com/sclevine/yj)

# Why Lua?

Because Pandoc is the GOAT and I need to put every question through it seperately.
The only two languages that can do that efficiently are Lua and Haskell.

# Why are the languages hardcoded?

Because additonal languages just would not be maintained.
