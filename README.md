## Build Requirements

* [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
* [yj](https://github.com/sclevine/yj)

# Why Lua?

Because Pandoc is the GOAT (well, except templates it seems, but now I've
already done it like that...) and I need to put every question through it
seperately. The only two languages that can do that efficiently are Lua and
Haskell.

# Why are the languages hardcoded?

Because additonal languages just would not be maintained.
